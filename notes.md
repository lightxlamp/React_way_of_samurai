1) It is better to start name component with a capital letter. To avoid tags/components confusion (<header> / <Header>)
comment by Stas: Do not believe author =) Read react style guide. Because just noticed, we have <logo> tag in React sample app
2) JSX can return only 1 root element 
3) To use JSX we must import React/ {Component}
4) JSX: we are not in HTML, so write className not just a "class"
5) It is so easy to add SCSS... https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_sass.asp
6) Component used this way: <Header /> has { } as a props  
7) Component used this way: <Header name="Stas S." /> has { name: "Stas S." } as a props  
8) CRA = Create React App in docs

Just checked that in 2021 we still have to install "react-router-dom" for routing. (like it has been done in 2018-2019)
Added routes using this article. Not a video lesson
