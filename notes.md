1) It is better to start name component with a capital letter. To avoid tags/components confusion (<header> / <Header>)
comment by Stas: Do not believe author =) Read react style guide. Because just noticed, we have <logo> tag in React sample app
2) JSX can return only 1 root element 
3) To use JSX we must import React/ {Component}
