1) It is better to start name component with a capital letter. To avoid tags/components confusion (<header> / <Header>)
comment by Stas: Do not believe author =) Read react style guide. Because just noticed, we have <logo> tag in React sample app
2) JSX can return only 1 root element 
3) To use JSX we must import React/ {Component}
4) JSX: we are not in HTML, so write className not just a "class"
5) It is so easy to add SCSS... https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_sass.asp
